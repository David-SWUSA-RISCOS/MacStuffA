# Macintosh Stuff

This is an attempt to get back into writing programs for the Classic Macintosh System Software.  As I need to relearn the OS some things here will be simple things created to relearn the API and details of writing Pascal and Assembly language software on the Classic Macintosh System Software.

As I work on getting back into the Classic Macintosh Sofware, I will be attempting to equal and parallel my progress here with equal stuff for the Apple IIgs running GS/OS.

This will be where any small truly PD (see the license file) programs I create for the Macintosh will be given a home.

The license chosen is PD, so it is officially the **Unlicense**.


## FOOTNOTES:

**NOTE 00:** Normally I am a bit slow at updating things, though as I need to relearn the OS and programming for it this is likely to be slower than my normal.

**NOTE 01:**  RISC OS is no longer the main focus of mine.  I am slowly moving more into using Macintosh and Amiga Computers, just need to port RPCEmu (or write a new RiscPC Emulator for these Operating Systems).

**NOTE 0F:** The YASDOE repository is in the process of being redone, as it will in the future hold an OS project to create an Open Source replacement ROM for running Macintosh System Software on Macintosh Computers and/or emulators.  That is the first step in creating a new Open Source OS that can be kept up to date to run our great library of software.
