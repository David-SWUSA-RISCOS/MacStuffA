# C64 amd 128 Stuff.

The name still fits, as there are three different Commodore 128/64 assemblers whose names begin with 'Mac'.

Getting back to the core, and what is likely the best long term path as well.  8-bit is great in the ways to go, and the C128D with the long keyboard (the one with the inverted T arrow keys) is my favorite of the 8-Bit World.   As I continue into this path it is likely that other 8-bit Systems will revieve repos here as well.
