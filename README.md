# 8-Bit Computing:

Mac or MAC, that is Macro-Assembler.  This repo is a place to contain a bit of 6502/65c02/65816, z80, and CDP1802 Assembly Language, some macro assembly and some simpler assembly.  There will also be s a little bit of interpreter BASIC code here, primarily in the dialects of ATOM BASIC, BBC BASIC, INTEGER BASIC, and Atari BASIC (never cared much for interpreted MS-BASIC because of the slow down design of the interpreter).  A couple of things specifically for compiled BASIC may also come to pass.

Getting back to the core, and what is likely the best long term path as well.  8-bit is great in the ways to go, to design usable desktop computers for extreme long term usage.   As I continue into this path it is likely that other 8-bit Systems will revieve repos here as well.


### Going very Long Term Desktop Computer usage.

This and my [RISC OS Stuff](https://github.com/David-SWUSA-RISCOS/RISCOSStuff/) repos are my ongoing focus.  The goal is to enjoy coding, and promote the design and use of extreme long term usage Desktop Computers (Desktop Systems designed to be used for 5 decades or more without replacement, both software and hardware).  We have had Desktop Personal Computers for about 50 years now, so we now are in a place to look at what has been reliable for these things and what has not been so reliable.

Long term computing is needed moving forward.  We need to reduce the energy and material usage of replacing our computing devices too often, we need to reduce the energy usage of sending them through tech recyclers after we are done with them.  Ideally we should have computers that will be in continous use for as long as possible.  This also means STOP pushing for people to use more powerful CPU's when it is not needed (like internet based applications, video viewing/editing, 3D-Modeling).  Many tasks can be done easily and well in real time with a lot lower end HW that is pushed, if the programmers give thought to these things, and use file formats that do not need to strain the CPU or other processors in our computers.

While I focus on the issue of long term computing from the view of Desktop Computing (including laptops), the issue also applies to other computing applications.  For long  term computing we also need to prolong the life of handheld computers ('Smart' Cell Phones, Digital Music players, GPS mapping systems, etc), as well as embeded devices (thermastats, lighting control systems, engine control and monitoring systems, etc).  These are areas that others are looking into as well.  My area is primarily the Desktop Comuting view of things.
