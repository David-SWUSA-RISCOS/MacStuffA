# Macintosh Stuff

This is an attempt to get back into writing programs for the Classic Macintosh System Software.  As I need to relearn the OS some things here will be simple things created to relearn the API and details of writing Pascal and Assembly language software on the Classic Macintosh System Software.

This will be where any small truly PD (see the license file) programs I create for the Macintosh will be given a home.

The license chosen is PD, so it is officially the **Unlicense**.
